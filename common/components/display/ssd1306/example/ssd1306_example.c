 *
 * \section intro Introduction
 * This simple example shows how to use the \ref ssd1306_oled_controller_group
 * for interfacing the SSD1306 controller
 *
 * \section files Main files:
 * - ssd1306_example.c: the SSD1306 low level driver example
 * - conf_ssd1306.h: configuration of the SSD1306 controller and interface
 * - conf_board.h: configuration for the board
 * - conf_clock.h: configuration for the clocks used in the device
 * - interface configuration files.
 *
 * \section apiinfo SSD1306 low level driver API
 * The SSD1306 low level driver API can be found
 * \ref ssd1306_lcd_controller_group "here".
 *
 * \section deviceinfo Device Info
 * All devices with a SPI (USART SPI) can be used.
 * \note Parallel interface is also possible, but not currently supported by the
 * driver.
 *
 * \section exampledescription Description of the example
 * The display is initialized and a pattern with alternating lines are drawn to
 * the entire screen. After this the screen is scrolled line by line using the
 * hardware scrolling function available in the LCD controller.
 *
 * \section compinfo Compilation Info
 * This software was written for the GNU GCC and IAR.
 * Other compilers may or may not work.
