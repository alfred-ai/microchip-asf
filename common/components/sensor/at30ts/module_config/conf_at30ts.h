/** \brief ACK_POLLING_INTERATION
 *
 * With an oscilloscope or logic analyzer, determine the number of NACK
 * iteration required for ts_ack_polling() to span 5ms.  5ms is the
 * maximum time required for a nonvolatile operation to complete.
 *
 * For example: With the F_CPU running at 16MHz and an optimization of -O2,
 * it takes 165 iterations of ts_ack_polling to span 5ms.
