/**
 * \page mqtt_quickstart Quick start guide for MQTT service
 *
 * This is the quick start guide for the how to configure and use the MQTT service.
 *
 *
 * \section mqtt_operation Basic operations of MQTT
 * MQTT is formed by the following operations.
 * -# \ref mqtt_opearion_connect
 * -# \ref mqtt_opearion_publish
 * -# \ref mqtt_opearion_subscribe
 * -# \ref mqtt_opearion_unsubscribe
 * -# \ref mqtt_opearion_disconnect
 *
 * Before performing this operations, must call \ref mqtt_init function.
 *
 * \subsection mqtt_opearion_connect Connect
 * -# Connect operation is required for the other operations.
 * -# Connect operation is consist of following 2 functions.
 * \code
 * mqtt_connect : This function preforms the connect to MQTT broker server.
 * mqtt_connect_broker : This function preforms the authenticate and configure options to the MQTT broker server.
 * \endcode
 * -# After \ref mqtt_connect operation has completed \ref MQTT_CALLBACK_SOCK_CONNECTED event will produced. It means server was found and connected.
 * -# After that you should call \ref mqtt_connect_broker function and configure this MQTT connection. After this operation finished, \ref MQTT_CALLBACK_CONNECTED event will produced.
 *
 * \subsection mqtt_opearion_publish Publish
 * -# Publish operation perform the send message to all of subscribers that share the same topic.
 * -# Publish operation is consist of following function.
 * \code
 * mqtt_publish : This function preforms the publish message to the subscribers
 * \endcode
 *
 * \subsection mqtt_opearion_subscribe Subscribe
 * -# Subscribe operation is used to get the message on a particular topic when it is generated.
 * -# Subscribe operation is consist of following function.
 * \code
 * mqtt_subscribe : This function preforms the subscription of the topic.
 * \endcode
 *
 * \subsection mqtt_opearion_disconnect Disconnect
 * -# Disconnect operation is used to disconnect from the MQTT broker server.
 * -# Disconnect operation is consist of following function.
 * \code
 * mqtt_unsubscribe : This function preforms the unsubscribe topic.
 * \endcode
 *
 * \subsection mqtt_opearion_unsubscribe Unsubscribe
 * -# Unsubscribe operation is used to cancel a subscription of the specific topic.
 * -# Unsubscribe operation is consist of following function.
 * \code
 * mqtt_disconnect : This function preforms the disconnection from the broker server.
 * \endcode
