 /**
 * \mainpage Sleep manager example
 *
 * \section intro Introduction
 * This simple example shows how to use the \ref sleepmgr_group.
 *
 * \section files Main files:
 * - sleepmgr_example_sam_rtt.c: Sleep manager example application
 * - conf_example.h: configuration of I/O pins
 *
 * \section apiinfo Sleep manager API
 * The sleep manager API can be found \ref sleepmgr_group "here".
 *
 * \section deviceinfo Device Info
 * All SAM series devices can be used.
 * The example has been tested on the boards:
 *  - SAM4N Xplained Pro kit
 *  - SAMG53 Xplained Pro kit
 *  - SAMG55 Xplained Pro kit
 *  - SAM4C evaluation kit
 *
 * \section exampledescription Description of the example
 * The device is put to sleep in sleep modes with increasing "depth", and is
 * periodically woken up by the RTT_ALARM.  The RTT_ALARM wakes the CPU
 * every 5 seconds.
 * The device will remain in ACTIVE mode for approximately 3 seconds after wake-
 * up, before it goes to sleep in the next mode.
 *
 * A pin (\ref LED_ACTIVITY_STATUS_PIN) with, e.g., a LED connected is driven
 * low when the device is active and driven high when the device is sleeping.
 *
 * \section compinfo Compilation Info
 * This software was written for the GNU GCC and IAR.
 * Other compilers may or may not work.
