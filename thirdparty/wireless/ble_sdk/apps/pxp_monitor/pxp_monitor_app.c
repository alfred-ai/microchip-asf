 * \mainpage PXP monitor application
 * \section Introduction
 * ******************************Introduction ***********************************
 *
 * The PXP-Monitor example application bring-up the Proximity profile defined 
 * by the Bluetooth SIG which would receives the proximity information from Proximity
 * reporter enbled BLE device.
 * The Proximity monitor example application supports the following features:
 *  + Device discovery and disconnection.
 *  + Services and characteristics discovery.
 *  + Services : Link Loss Service, Immediate Alert Service and TX Power Service.
 *  + Setting up path loss and link loss.
 *  + RSSI sampling.
 *
 * - Supported Evolution Kit -
 *	+ ATSAML21-XPRO-B + ATBTLC1000 XPRO
 *	+ ATSAMD21-XPRO + ATBTLC1000 XPRO
 *	+ ATSAMG55-XPRO + ATBTLC1000 XPRO
 *	+ ATSAM4S-XPRO + ATBTLC1000 XPRO
 * 
 * - Running the demo -
 *  + 1. Build and flash the binary into supported evaluation board.
 *  + 2. Open the console using TeraTerm or any serial port monitor.
 *  + 3. Press the Reset button.
 *  + 4. Wait for around 10 seconds for the patches to be downloaded device will initialize and start-up.
 *  + 5. Initializes the proximity monitor applications.
 *  + 6. Device will start scan and will displays the list of all BLE devices which
 *       are advertising. Proximity reporter devices(GATT server role) are indicated
 *       with tag "--PXP".Select the appropriate index number of the proximity reporter
 *       The Proximity Monitor will then connect to the selected peer device.
 *  + 7. Once connection is established the PXP-Monitor will set link loss alert value
 *       to high alert and starts monitoring the RSSI value of the reporter device.
 *       The proximity reporter supports also ‘Immediate Alert Service’ and
 *      ‘Tx-Power’ service. The Atmel Proximity Reporter application referred in 
 *       this example supports both these optional services.
 *
 * \section Modules
 * ***************************** MODULES ***************************************** 
 * - BLE Manager - 
 *  + The Event Manager is responsible for handling the following:
 *    + Generic BLE Event Handling:-
 *       + BLE Event Manager handles the events triggered by BLE stack and also responsible 
 *  	 for invoking all registered callbacks for respective events. BLE Manager 
 *  	 handles all GAP related functionality. In addition to that handles multiple connection 
 *  	 instances, Pairing, Encryption, Scanning.
 *    + Handling Multi-role/multi-connection:-
 *  	  + BLE Event Manager is responsible for handling multiple connection instances 
 *  	  and stores bonding information and Keys to retain the bonded device. 
 *  	  BLE Manager is able to identify and remove the device information when pairing/encryption 
 *		  gets failed. In case of multi-role, it handles the state/event handling of both central and peripheral in multiple contexts.
 *    + Controlling the Advertisement data:-
 *  	  + BLE Event Manager is responsible for generating the advertisement and scan response data
 *  	  for BLE profiles/services that are attached with BLE Manager.
 *
 * - BLE Profile-
 *  + The Proximity profile defines the behavior when a device moves away from a 
 *    peer device so that the connection is dropped or the path loss increases 
 *    above a preset level, causing an immediate alert. This alert can be used 
 *     to notify the user about disconnection of the devices from each other. As a consequence
 *    of this alert, a device may take further action, for example to lock one of
 *    the devices so that it is no longer usable.
 *	+ The Proximity monitor - shall be a GATT client.
 *
 *    The Proximity monitor Profile supports three services:
 *    + Link Loss service -
 *      + The Link Loss service defines behavior when a link is lost between two devices.
 *    + Immediate Alert service -
 *      + The Immediate Alert service defines behavior when a link is lost between two devices.
 *    + Tx Power service -
 *      + The Tx Power service exposes a device’s current transmit power level when in a connection.
 *
 * - BLE Platform Services -
 *  +  Interface Settings -
 *	  + Connect ATBTLC1000 XPRO to SAML21-XPRO-B -> EXT1
 *	  + Connect ATBTLC1000 XPRO to SAMD21-XPRO -> EXT1
 *	  + Connect ATBTLC1000 XPRO to SAMG55-XPRO -> EXT1
 *	  + Connect ATBTLC1000 XPRO to SAM4S-XPRO  -> EXT1
 *  +  Serial Console COM port settings -
 *    + Baudrate 115200
 *	  + Parity None, Stop Bit 1, Start Bit 1
