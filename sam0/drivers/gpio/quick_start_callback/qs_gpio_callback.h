/**
 * \page asfdoc_samb_gpio_callback_use_case Quick Start Guide for GPIO - Callback
 *
 * In this use case, the GPIO module is configured for:
 *  \li One pin as an external interrupt with rising edge
 *  \li UART to print message on getting the interrupt
 *
 * The GPIO Controller also allows all GPIO pins (LP_GPIO_x, GPIO_MSy, AO_GPIO_z) to 
 * be configured as interrupt lines. Each interrupt line can be individually masked 
 * and can generate an interrupt to CPU on rising, falling, or on high or low levels. 
 *
 * \subsection asfdoc_samb_gpio_callback_use_case_setup_code Code
 * Copy-paste the following setup code to your user application:
 * \snippet qs_gpio_callback.c setup
 *
 * Add to user application initialization (typically the start of \c main()):
 * \snippet qs_gpio_callback.c setup_init
 *
 * \subsection asfdoc_samb_gpio_callback_use_case_setup_flow Workflow
 * -# Create a UART module configuration struct.
 *    \snippet qs_gpio_callback.c setup_uart_1
 * -# Initialize the config_uart configuration struct with the module's default values.
 *    \snippet qs_gpio_callback.c setup_uart_2 
 *    \note This should always be performed before using the configuration
 *          struct to ensure that all values are initialized to known default
 *          settings.
 *
 * -# Adjust the configuration struct to request setting.
 *    \snippet qs_gpio_callback.c setup_uart_3
 *
 * -# Configure UART with the initialized configuration struct, to enable
 *    the driver.
 *    \snippet qs_gpio_callback.c setup_uart_4
 *
 * -# Create a GPIO module pin configuration struct. Initialize the pin configuration
 *    struct with the module's default values.
 *    \snippet qs_gpio_callback.c setup_gpio_1
 *    \note This should always be performed before using the configuration
 *          struct to ensure that all values are initialized to known default
 *          settings.
 *
 * -# Adjust the configuration struct to request an input pin.
 *    \snippet qs_gpio_callback.c setup_gpio_2
 *
 * -# Configure GPIO pin with the initialized pin configuration struct.
 *    \snippet qs_gpio_callback.c setup_gpio_3
 *
 * -# Initialize callback function. This assigns the GPIO ISR handler address in
 *    interrupt vector table.
 *    \snippet qs_gpio_callback.c callback_init
 *
 * -# Register callback function.
 *    \snippet qs_gpio_callback.c callback_reg
 * -# Enable callback function. This enables the interrupt
 *    \snippet qs_gpio_callback.c callback_en
