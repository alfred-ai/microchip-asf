 /** \page asfdoc_sam0_power_basic_use_case Quick Start Guide for Power Driver
 *
 * The supported board list:
 *    - SAM L21 Xplained Pro
 *
 * This example demonstrates how to use the power driver. BUTTON0 is used to
 * wake up system from standby mode and as an external wake up
 * pin to wake up system from BACKUP mode. The wakeup pin level is low.
 * PB22/PB23 are used as GCLK0/GCLK1 output pin, oscilloscope can be used to
 * monitor their clock frequency.
 *
 * After POR, LED0 is ON and GCLK0/GCLK1 are running at 4MHz, after one second,
 * LED0 becomes OFF and system enters standby mode. BUTTON0 can be used to wake up
 * system. After system wake up, LED0 becomes ON and performance level switch to PL2,
 * GCLK0 is running at 48MHz, GCLK1 is running at 4MHz. Then LED0 toggles
 * two times and becomes OFF, system enters BACKUP mode.
 *
 * When PA04 is connected to low level, system wakes up from BACKUP mode, LED0
 * toggles four times. GCLK0/GCLK1 are running at 4MHz.
