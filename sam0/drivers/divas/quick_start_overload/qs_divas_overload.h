/**
 * \page asfdoc_sam0_divas_overload_use_case Quick Start Guide for DIVAS - Overload
 *
 * In this use case, the Divide and Square Root Accelerator (DIVAS) module is 
 * used.
 *
 * This use case will calculate the data in overload mode. If all the calculation 
 * results are the same as the desired results, the board LED will be lighted.
 * Otherwise, the board LED will be flashing. The variable "result" can indicate 
 * which calculation is wrong.
 *
 * \section asfdoc_sam0_divas_overload_use_case_setup Setup
 *
 * \subsection asfdoc_sam0_divas_overload_use_case_setup_prereq Prerequisites
 * There are no special setup requirements for this use-case.
 *
 * \subsection asfdoc_sam0_divas_overload_use_case_setup_code Code
 * The following must be added to the user application source file, outside
 * any function:
 
 * The signed and unsigned dividend: 
 * \snippet qs_divas_overload.c buffer

 * Copy-paste the following function code to your user application:
 * \snippet qs_divas_overload.c calculate
 *
 * Add to user application initialization (typically the start of \c main()):
 * \snippet qs_divas_overload.c setup_init
 *
 * \section asfdoc_sam0_divas_overload_use_case_imp Implementation
 *
 * \subsection asfdoc_sam0_trng_overload_use_case_imp_code Code
 * Copy-paste the following code to your user application:
 * \snippet qs_divas_overload.c main
 *
 * \subsection asfdoc_sam0_divas_overload_use_case_imp_flow Workflow
 * -# Signed division calculation.
 *    \snippet qs_divas_overload.c main_1
 * -# Unsigned division calculation.
 *    \snippet qs_divas_overload.c main_2
 * -# Signed reminder calculation.
 *    \snippet qs_divas_overload.c main_3
 * -# Unsigned reminder calculation.
 *    \snippet qs_divas_overload.c main_4
 * -# Square root calculation.
 *    \snippet qs_divas_overload.c main_5
 * -# Infinite loop.
 *    \snippet qs_divas_overload.c main_6
