 * \section asfdoc_sam_drivers_aes_example2_intro Introduction
 * This is the documentation for the data structures, functions, variables,
 * defines, enums, and typedefs for the AES driver. <BR>It also gives several
 * examples of usage of the AES-GCM mode: <BR>
 * - GCM ciphering and deciphering.
 *
 * \section asfdoc_sam_drivers_aes_example2_files Main Files
 * - aes.c : AES driver
 * - aes.h : AES header file
 * - gcm_example.c : AES-GCM code example
 *
 * \section asfdoc_sam_drivers_aes_example2_compinfo Compilation Info
 * This software was written for the GNU GCC and IAR Systems compiler.
 * Other compilers may or may not work.
 *
 * \section asfdoc_sam_drivers_aes_example2_deviceinfo Device Info
 * All SAM devices with an AES-GCM feature can be used. This example has been
 * tested with the following setup:<BR>
 * - SAM4C evaluation kit.
 *
 * \section asfdoc_sam_drivers_aes_example2_setupinfo Setup Information
