/**
 * \mainpage Bit Banding Example
 *
 * \section Purpose
 *
 * The cm3-bitbanding example will help new users get familiar with
 * bitbanding feature of SAM3 microcontrollers.
 *
 * Bit-banding is a useful feature of Cortex M3 processor. The processor memory map
 * includes two bit-band regions, which occupy the lowest 1MB of the SRAM and
 * Peripheral memory regions. These bit-band regions map each word in an alias
 * region of memory to a bit in a bit-band region of memory. 
 *
 * The example will execute the following tests:
 * - Test REGISTER bit-banding accessing with LED0
 *   (BitbandingPeripheralTest())
 *
 * \section Requirements
 *
 * This package can be used with SAM3 evaluation kits.
 *
 * \section Description
 * The cm3-bitbanding example will help new users get familiar with
 * bitbanding feature of SAM3 microcontrollers.
 *
 * \section Usage
 *
 * -# Build the program and download it into the evaluation board.
